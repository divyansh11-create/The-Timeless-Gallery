    <h2>Curatorial Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Our aim is to present works that explore memory, space, and imagination. From Van Gogh's
      swirling skies to Dalí's dreamlike clocks, each piece invites reflection on time and perception.
      We place equal value on historical masterpieces and modern digital expression.
